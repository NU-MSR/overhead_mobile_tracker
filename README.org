* Intro 
This is a simple package for tracking a mobile robot using an overhead camera.
The user places a tag on the robot, and the [[http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar][ar_track_alvar]] package estimates the
transform from the camera to the tag. After a calibration procedure, we are able
to transform the pose of the tag in the camera frame into a "driving frame"
(default name is =odom_meas=). The tag's pose is projected down into the /x-y/
plane of the driving frame, and we only consider rotations about the driving
frame's z-axis.

* Launch Files
**  =calibrate_system.launch=
   This launch file is used for calibrating the system. Once the system is
   calibrated, the user is given the option of writing the calibration into a
   launch file that will setup a =static_transform_publisher= from the camera
   frame into the driving frame. The primary node is [[file:src/system_calibrator.py][system_calibrator.py]], the
   parameters that can be set for this node are described in detail in the
   header of the code.

** =run_system_ar_track_alvar.launch=
   This launch file is the primary launch file for running the system after
   calibration. The primary node is [[file:src/mobile_tracker.py][mobile_tracker.py]]. Its relevant topics,
   parameters, and services are described at the top of the source code.


* Miscellaneous Notes and Debugging
** Camera Drivers
   I have occasionally had issues with [[http://wiki.ros.org/uvc_camera][uvc_camera]], [[http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam][usb_cam]], and [[http://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera][libuvc_camera]]
   when trying to start the Microsoft LifeCam that is attached to the ceiling in
   D110. Right now the default is to use =usb_cam=. If you're experiencing
   issues, you could try one of the other camera drivers. If the camera is
   having trouble starting even with tools such as =cheese= or =guvcview=,
   you're likely experiencing some sort of issue with the uvc camera module.
   I've had luck with the following steps:
   1. Unplug camera
   2. Remove the camera kernel module: =sudo rmmod uvcvideo=
   3. Re-insert the camera module: =sudo modprobe uvcvideo=
   4. Reload the usb hotplugging daemon service: =sudo service udev reload=
   5. Re-plug in the camera

** Camera Calibration
   I've provided a [[file:launch/overhead_tracker_camera.yaml][camera calibration file]] for the camera mounted on the ceiling
   in D110 at 1280x720 resolution. Feel free to calibrate the camera at a
   different resolution if you need.

** Tag Numbers
   The default tag id is 12. I've included a copy of this tag as
   [[file:data/MarkerData_12.png][data/MarkerData_12.png]], and I have a printed version pasted onto a flat piece
   of particle board in D110. Feel free to re-print this tag, or print a
   different tag. Just be sure to update the tag size and the tag id in the
   launch files (or with command line args).
